* The block groups directory has some dataset pertaining to block groups used for interpolation in our paper. 
* The dataset directory has some datasets used for interpolation.
* The notebook directory has all the Jupyter Notebooks needed for replication of all the experiments. 
* For computing centroids at every block group, we use the following [publicly available dataset](https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/d3a11165055747068a5a456c2e2f0e31_0).

The notebooks correspond to the following in the paper:
